# The essence of the document
At the analysis step, the terms of reference or a specific subject area of the external world are studied — they are 
read from beginning to end 2-3 times with a brief summary of the most important points. Next, a detailed study of TK 
begins, during which "non-programmatic" abstractions are highlighted. At the same time, the corresponding 
administrative divisions themselves can be very abstract, immaterial: for example, in addition to the Car class, 
a driving class may well be allocated if one of the important goals of the project is a direct study of such 
a convenience. Another classic example is the Cheshire Cat Smile class.

That is, a good final set of analysis classes is characterized not by the proximity of these classes to the explicit 
entities of the studied subject area, but by their long-term significance for the entire project.
