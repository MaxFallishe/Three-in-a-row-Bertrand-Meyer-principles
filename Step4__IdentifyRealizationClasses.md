# The essence of the document
Implementation classes define universal, fairly simple and fundamental (within the framework of the project) 
data structures like linked lists or dynamic arrays. The peculiarity is that, as a rule, their implementation should be
very effective, which significantly complicates coding and implies a good knowledge of algorithms and computer science. 
An error in choosing an algorithm can be costly.

But, as a rule, implementation classes are easily identified by an experienced designer. In addition, a variety of 
universal data structures are usually available in standard libraries, and it is enough to redefine or expand them a 
little for specific tasks, and very often take ready-made ones.
